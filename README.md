# Hungry-Snake
This is my first project. It's a file to reproduce the famous game "Snake" with python-tkinter. Use 'w', 'a', 's', 'd' to control your snake to survive and eat as much food as possible to get high score. Enjoy!
This python script is done under python 3.7. No special requirement is needed except python itself.

I may fix a direction control bug in next patch.
